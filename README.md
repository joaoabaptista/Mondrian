Mondrian-Inspired Web Page
This project is a web page designed with inspiration from the iconic style of Piet Mondrian, built using only HTML and CSS. It's a creative exercise to develop and improve frontend skills, especially in layout and design. There's also a small surprise hidden behind one of the squaresâ€”see if you can find it!
